# Evaluation plan (MVP)

## Method
- Task-based usability test + SUS questionnaire.
- Collect time-to-plan and qualitative feedback.

## Tasks (example)
1. Create an assignment task with due date.
2. Break it into 4 subtasks and mark one as done.
3. Create a note for reference material and link it to the task.
4. Schedule a reminder 2 minutes in the future; observe the in-app reminder.
5. Fill in Daily Reflection for today.

## Metrics
- SUS score.
- Time to complete tasks 1–3.
- Qualitative: what confused users, what helped, what is missing.

## Data handling
- Store participant results separately from personal identifiers.
- Do not collect sensitive personal details beyond mood/productivity ratings.
